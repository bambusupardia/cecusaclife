He then wiped away the areas of the asphalt not hardened by sunlight to reveal a primitive photograph.</p></span><span class=credit>Joseph Nicéphore Niépce/Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The First African-American To Play Major League Baseball (1884)</h2><span class=caption-body>On May 1, 1884 — 63 years before Jackie Robinson's debut — Moses Fleetwood Walker became the first African-American to play Major League Baseball. He played just 42 games for the Toledo Blue Stockings before suffering an injury and returning to the minor leagues for the rest of his career.<p>What's more, five years before Walker's debut, a man named William Edward White played exactly one game for the Providence Grays, perhaps making him the first African-American to play in the major leagues. However, with very spotty historical records suggesting that White was perhaps the son of a white planter and a mixed race mother, White's claim to be first remains significantly contested.</p></span><span class=credit>National Baseball Hall of Fame/Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The First Text Message (1992)</h2><span class=caption-body>On December 3, 1992, 22-year-old British engineer Neil Papworth, part of a team working on developing SMS for Vodafone, sent the world's first text message to Vodafone executive Richard Jarvis. It read "Merry Christmas."<p>By 2000, each American was still only sending about 35 text messages per month. And it wouldn't be until 2007 that texting would surpass calling in popularity across the U.S.</p></span><span class=credit>Neil Papworth</span><h2 class=title>The First Color Photograph (1861)</h2><span class=caption-body>Kodak wouldn't introduce color film to the masses until 1935, but color photography had actually been around since 1861.<p>That year, Thomas Sutton and James Clerk Maxwell collaborated on what's now widely accepted to be the world's first color photograph (pictured), depicting a classic Scottish tartan ribbon of red, white, and green.</p><p>They created the image by photographing the same ribbon three times with three different filters (red, green, and blue-violet), then superimposing the three together, in a process whose basic three-color method underscores all color imaging to this day.</p></span><span class=credit>James Clerk Maxwell/Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The First Cell Phone (1973)</h2><span class=caption-body>On April 3, 1973, Motorola employee Martin Cooper (pictured, in 2011, holding a replica of his original cell phone) made the first mobile phone call in history, connecting with Bell Labs in New Jersey while standing on Sixth Avenue in New York (he doesn't remember exactly what he said).<p>But most of the world wouldn't become aware of what Cooper and his team had done until much later. In the words of <a href=#>The Atlantic</a>, "it would take another decade for the DynaTAC to reach consumers and two more decades for cell phones to overtake land lines in worldwide usage."</p></span><span class=credit>Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for The Webby Awards</span><h2 class=title>The First Selfie (1839)</h2><span class=caption-body>While the first usage of the word "selfie" uncovered by Oxford Dictionaries didn't occur until 2002, the world's first known photographic self-portrait was taken long before. In 1839, amateur chemist and photography enthusiast Robert Cornelius snapped the world's first selfie inside his family's store in Philadelphia.<p>Without the luxury of being able to simply push a button for immediate results, Cornelius had to remove the camera's lens cap, run into frame, and hold his pose for a full minute in order to come away with this image.</p></span><span class=credit>Robert Cornelius/Library of Congress</span><h2 class=title>The First Email (1971)</h2><span class=caption-body>In 1973 — a full 16 years before "You've got mail" and a solid two decades before email became common outside of government, military, and university settings — American programmer Ray Tomlinson (pictured, in 2009) pioneered and implemented the world's first email system, right down to the name and address format we still use today.<p>Just don't ask him what that historic first email said. "The test messages were entirely forgettable," he later told <a href=#>The New York Times</a>, "and I have, therefore, forgotten them."</p></span><span class=credit>MIGUEL RIOPA/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>The First Transatlantic Flight (1919)</h2><span class=caption-body>The first pilot to make a nonstop flight across the Atlantic was Charles Lindbergh, right? Wrong.

Strikingly tall, bedecked in classic leather pilot's cap and goggles, "Lucky Lindy" could sit in the cockpit of the Spirit of St. Louis and look every bit the part of the romantic hero of aviation's so-called golden age.</p><p>When The New York Times ran its <a href=#>front-page story</a> on the completion of Lindbergh's historic transatlantic flight on May 21, 1927, the newspaper described his landing with breathless grandiloquence:</p><p>"Those first to arrive at the plane had a picture that will live in their minds for the rest of their lives. His cap off, his famous locks falling in disarray around his eyes, 'Lucky Lindy' sat peering out over the rim of the little cockpit of his machine."</p><p>Yet nowhere did The New York Times mention — nor did many of those who idolized Lindy in the coming decades seem to realize — that Charles Lindbergh was not the first pilot to fly nonstop across the Atlantic, nor by some technicality the second or third, but instead the 19th.</p><p>Almost exactly eight years before Lindbergh's flight, British pilots John Alcock and Arthur Brown completed what was truly the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Ireland.</p><p>Lindbergh's distinction was that he was the first pilot to make the flight solo -- a qualifier some of us care to remember today, but one many of us surely don't.</p><p>And it is an important qualifier, but not important enough to explain why, today, no one (at least in America) remembers Alcock and Brown while everyone remembers Lindbergh.</p><p>Of course, some of the biggest reasons that we remember Lindbergh and not Alcock and Brown are that Lindbergh was handsome, that he looked great in flight gear, that he was an American man who'd quickly risen from underdog obscurity to fly from New York to Paris (not Newfoundland to Ireland) at the height of American Jazz Age affluence and glamour — that his story, not necessarily his actual accomplishment, was a better one.</p><p>And thus so many of us seem to remember Lindbergh's transatlantic flight as the first. Even <a href=#>National Geographic</a>, writing as recently as 2013, made that very error over the course of an entire article before appending a correction at a later time.</p><p>All of this tells us something about how our collective memory, if not the history books themselves, choose to mark history's most famous "firsts." Time and again, we'll go with the better story regardless of its accuracy.</p><p>Sometimes, this means that some of history's most famous firsts actually occurred long before we realize they did. It may also mean that a first was so far ahead of its time that we all but refuse to believe that it could have occurred so long ago.</p><p>This is how we end up remembering Jackie Robinson as the first African-American in Major League Baseball — and not the man who played just 42 unremarkable games in one season for a smaller team all the way back in 1884.</p><p>Or how we find it nearly impossible to process the fact (if we've ever even heard it) that color photography was invented in 1861 — 78 years before The Wizard of Oz and some 90 years before our imagination of history itself stopped existing solely in black and white.</p><p>See more famous firsts that happened long before you thought they did in the gallery above.</p><p>Next, discover six <a href=#>famous inventors</a> who don't actually deserve credit for their most noteworthy invention.
