We had to then try and evaluate it and invalidate it or whatever,’ he said. ‘In an instance like that there were a limited range of things you could do, which we did.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said they checked dates and people’s movements and found that Trump was in Moscow at the time.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It meant that for the first time there was a potentially serious situation of kompromat against a presidential candidate,’ Steele added. ‘We immediately decided that we had to report it into the FBI.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We suddenly found ourselves with a hot potato,’ Burrows recounted.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Steele told Stephanopoulos that he continues to mostly believe that the ‘golden showers’ tape exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I think that it probably does, but I wouldn’t put 100 per cent certainty on it,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘So how do you explain if that tape does indeed exist, it hasn’t been released?’ the ABC reporter pushed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Well it hasn’t needed to be released?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Why not?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Because I think the Russians felt they got pretty good value out of Donald Trump when he was president of the U.S.,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Steele also told the broadcaster why he believed he didn’t get duped by the Russians.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some had suggested that the ‘golden showers’ story was pushed as part of Russian disinformation.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Ultimately any disinformation operation has an objective,’ Steele said. ‘It would have been disinformation about Hillary Clinton.
